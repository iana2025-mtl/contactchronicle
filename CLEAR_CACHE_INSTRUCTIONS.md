# Clear Browser Cache Instructions

The import function isn't loading because your browser has cached the old code. Follow these steps:

## Method 1: Hard Refresh (Quick)
1. Close all tabs with the app
2. Open a NEW tab
3. Go to the app
4. Press **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux)
5. Wait for the page to fully load
6. Click "📤 Import Contacts" - you should see an alert saying "VERSION 2.0"

## Method 2: Clear Cache Completely (Recommended)
1. **Safari:**
   - Go to Safari → Settings → Advanced
   - Check "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
   - Go to Develop → Empty Caches
   - Restart Safari

2. **Chrome:**
   - Press Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
   - Restart Chrome

3. **Firefox:**
   - Press Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows)
   - Select "Cache"
   - Click "Clear Now"
   - Restart Firefox

## Method 3: Use Private/Incognito Window
1. Open a private/incognito window
2. Go to the app (this will load fresh code)
3. Login and test the import

## What to Look For:
- When you click "📤 Import Contacts", you should see an alert: **"🚨🚨🚨 NEW IMPORT FUNCTION V2.0 CALLED 🚨🚨🚨"**
- If you DON'T see this alert, the old code is still cached
